%with \textbf{\href{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/}{Prof Jason Hong}} and \textbf{\href{http://www.synergylabs.org/yuvraj/}{Prof Yuvraj Agarwal}} 
\item PrivacyProxy is an app for \textbf{unmodified} android devices to detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by analyzing the network traffic of the crowd.
%\item I build an in-situ VPN Service which detects the PII being leaked, even over TLS traffic, in real time by comparing network request signatures of the crowd. 
\item Designed and implemented a Privacy-sensitive system which intelligently filters the PII before it leaves the device.
